1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

How I would characterize their audio aura is through different categories such as danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, valence and tempo.

2. Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

As everyone has their own personal preference, additionally since the data is from 2018 and music genre/taste changes over the years so it would be better to also include 2018 and onwards to calculate this data.
